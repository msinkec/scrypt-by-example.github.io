description: Require function in sCrypt

The `require()` function specifies terms/conditions of a contract. It consumes a boolean condition. If the condition is not met, the contract will abort execution and fail. Otherwise, the execution will resume.

Every public function must end with a `require()` call.

```javascript
{{{Test1}}}
```
